> **The easiest way to get a working free VPN — copy a subscription link, paste it into your client, connect.**  
> No signup. No payment. No installation of binaries. Refreshed hourly from public sources — every published node has demonstrably forwarded real HTTP traffic through sing-box minutes ago.

> Free VPN subscriptions · free proxy list · free v2ray / clash / sing-box · VLESS / Reality / VMess / Trojan / Shadowsocks / Hysteria2 · hourly refreshed · HTTP-over-proxy verified · by country

## 💡 Why This Project?

Every "free VPN" list on GitHub is either stale, full of dead nodes, or asks you to install a sketchy binary. This repo goes further than anything else you'll find — **we don't just check that a node answers the phone, we actually push HTTP traffic through it with sing-box and confirm a 204 comes back**, minutes before publishing. You get 3 portable subscription files — drop them into Clash, sing-box, or v2rayN and go.

## 🔬 How we verify nodes actually work

Most free-VPN lists stop at "the TCP port is open" and publish. We don't. Here is the full verification pipeline a node has to survive before it gets into the subscription.

### ✅ What we verify at aggregation time (before publishing)

1. **TCP reachability** — open a TCP connection to every `server:port`. Dead hosts, bad DNS, and blocked ports are dropped. ~40 % of raw entries fall out here.
2. **TLS handshake** — for every TLS / Reality / WS-TLS node we complete the full handshake. Expired certs, SNI mismatches, and broken Reality short-ids are dropped. ~10 % more fall out here.
3. **sing-box config validation** — every surviving node is translated into a real sing-box outbound and run through `sing-box check`. Corrupt ciphers, bad UUIDs, and unsupported flow options are dropped before they waste a probe slot.
4. **HTTP-over-proxy probe (this is the big one)** — we batch the fastest ~900 candidates into sing-box subprocesses, each node getting its own local SOCKS5 inbound, then push real HTTP + HTTPS GETs through it:
   - `http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` (expects 204)
   - `https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace` (expects 200)

   The request traverses the actual proxy protocol (VLESS / VMess / Trojan / Shadowsocks / Hysteria2), so a node that passes has demonstrably functioning auth, routing, TLS inner handshake, and exit networking.
5. **Two rounds, 45 seconds apart** — nodes that pass once but die 45 seconds later get filtered. Only nodes with ≥ 50 % success rate across all (rounds × targets) are kept.
6. **Median real-latency sort** — survivors are ranked by their median HTTP-over-proxy round-trip (not raw TCP RTT), and the top N are published.

Typical numbers from a recent run: **17 sources → ~4,800 raw → ~2,900 TCP-alive → ~2,600 TLS-OK → ~840 config-valid → ~280 HTTP-verified → top 150 published**. Every one of the 150 has actually forwarded traffic in the last ten minutes.

### ❌ What we still can't verify

- **Bandwidth / throughput** — we measure latency, not megabits. A 50 ms node may still be slow for video.
- **Geolocation precision** — GeoIP tells us the exit IP country but not the city or ISP reliably.
- **Region-specific blocks** — a node that works from our probe infra may be blocked from yours (ISP-level filtering, captive portals, etc.).
- **Staying alive past the run** — the node passed ten minutes ago; it may have died since.

### 🛡️ Runtime safety net — for the last bullet above

The `clash.yaml` we publish ships with a `url-test` proxy group that re-tests real HTTP through each node every 5 minutes on *your* device:

```yaml
proxy-groups:
  - name: AUTO
    type: url-test
    url: http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204
    interval: 300
```

Your client keeps the node list sorted by *live* HTTP-over-proxy latency from your network and auto-picks the fastest working node. sing-box and v2ray have equivalent mechanisms. If a selected node dies between hourly aggregations, the client switches to the next without intervention.

### 🧮 What this means in practice

Of the ~150 we publish each run, a typical client finds **80-120 nodes that serve HTTP cleanly from their network** at any given moment — roughly 2-3× the hit rate of lists that only do TCP probing. The url-test group rotates transparently if one drops out.

## ❓ FAQ

<details><summary>Is this actually free?</summary>

Yes. Nodes are operated by third-party volunteers who publish their own free subscriptions. We don't run any servers ourselves — we just test, rank, and repackage what's already public.

</details>

<details><summary>How fresh is the data?</summary>

Every hour (with a small random delay to avoid hammering upstream on the `:00` mark): pulls all sources, runs the full TCP → TLS → sing-box config check → HTTP-over-proxy probe pipeline (two rounds, 45 s apart), ranks by real HTTP latency, publishes new output files. Full pipeline takes ~10 minutes. See the `Last updated` badge above.

</details>

<details><summary>Can I trust these nodes?</summary>

Free nodes see all your traffic. **Never use them for banking, login, or anything sensitive.** Fine for bypassing geo-blocks on public content. Use your own VPS / paid provider for real privacy.

</details>

<details><summary>Why do some nodes fail even though they're listed?</summary>

Even after our HTTP-over-proxy probe, nodes can die between aggregations: quota exhausted, upstream revoked the key, your ISP blocks the exit IP, or the operator took it down. The published `clash.yaml` pairs every node with a `url-test` proxy group (`http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204`, 300 s interval) — your client auto-picks the fastest node that actually serves HTTP *from your network*. If one dies, pick the next. Expect 80-120 of the 150 to work at any given moment.
